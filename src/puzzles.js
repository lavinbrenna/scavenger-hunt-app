        puzzleText: "<p>'Words canโt begin to describe the love I have for you'. I think much of the time this kind of sentiment is used, people mean it as a placeholder to get across how BIG the love they have for someone is, that itโs too immense in scale to wrap their head around let alone convey it through words. But Iโve been thinking about the kind of small love in a relationship, that isnโt shown with extravagant proclamations or acts of self sacrifice. Iโve been thinking about the kind of love and kinship that we sometimes save for pets, that seems to fall outside of the bounds of human connection. Silent trustful understanding day in and out that the person you are with cares for you, loves you, wants to be close, wants to feel your warmth and that more often than not, that the place where they want to be and the place where they are happen to be the same.</p><p>I commit to Brenna to be a witness to her life, to see her be herself and to love her as she is now and to love who she will become. I commit to being her companion and her memory bank, to help remind her of the places weโve been and the friendships weโve made, to help her remember her achievements and help her see herself the way I see her. I commit to being her stupid little guy, to trying to catch her gaze long enough with a dance or a joke good enough to keep her attention. To distract her from the work she intends to do so that I can get my fill of the feeling that comes from the corners of her mouth turning up against her will, while she shakes her head in disbelief at what Iโll do to make her laugh.</p><p>Brenna already knows this, but we didnโt really want to write vows to each other. It was something that was partially imposed upon us to prove the truth of our love as a declaration to others. I said it to her in private, and Iโll say it here for the people in our lives to know. That words are just words. That my handle over them canโt convey how much life we share with each other, that your presence is so large in my experience of this one life that I have, that I canโt even take it all in at once anymore when I try. They canโt compare to how it feels when you look at me and smile, the feeling of belonging and security in my heart and my head that I feel at the end of each night while we unpack our day and talk about what weโre gonna do tomorrow. None of it can get across the decade weโve spent with each other, and how somehow, during that time, weโve only grown closer. Thereโs a short story called โOn Exactitude in Scienceโ in which the cartographers of an empire seek to make a map of perfect accuracy, and so they go about this task by recreating the details of the empire point for point in perfect scale and recreation, until the map takes up the full size of the empire itself. To convey to others what this life weโve built with each other is like, why we understand each other's wants and our faults, our motives and our fears, why we can see in each other who we were and who we are, it would just be words. It wouldnโt do, and it would take too long. So Iโll make it small; I love you and I feel loved by you. Letโs keep going until our brains turn to mush and bones turn to dust.</p>",

        puzzleText: "<p>'When we first started talking on OKCupid almost exactly 11 years ago, I thought that it wasn't going to work out. According to OKC's algorithm we only had a 70% chance of being a good match. It was an immediate swing and a miss when I reached out to you about your picture that I swore was in Las Vegas, and I was incredibly embarrassed that I was wrong. During our first date, I'm pretty sure my roommates at the time sabotaged your bike while it was parked at my house, and after you left I was afraid that you weren't going to want to get together again. But you've stuck around - even after the spending the weirdest Thanksgiving with me where my roommate just watched The Wire and ate day-old bagels out of a trash bag while I cooked a full dinner. Even after I annoyingly humble-bragged about a million things in the beginning. Even after you had to explain tons of jokes to me because I was too high to get them. Even after I revealed the reason I didnโt want to continue watching Big Love was because I also had secret credit card debt.</p><p>I know it's cliche but Iโm going to say it anyway because truly expressing myself with words is hard for me. I would be a much different person than I am today if I never met you, and I think I'm more authentically myself now than I was when we first met. Thank you for understanding me, for supporting me in all of my hobbies (even if you hate the amount of yarn I have), for challenging me to be a better version of myself and all of the other things you do for me that I can't list because we'd probably be here for hours. If we truly are living in a simulation, I'm glad that you're the person that it paired me with, and I'll gladly spend the rest of my life in this reality doing taxes and laundry with you.'</p> <p>What year did the first season of the HBO series The Wire premiere?</p>",
